# Image Picker

Image Picker opens the WordPress media modal, renders the selected thumbnail, and stores the image URL via `sanitize_pom_form_image_picker()`, which validates the saved URL before use.【F:src/Fields/Image_Picker.php†L7-L61】【F:src/class-sanitize.php†L184-L194】 See [Media pickers and assets](../fields.md#media-pickers-and-assets) for more examples.
