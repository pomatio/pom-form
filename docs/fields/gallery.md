# Gallery

Gallery opens the media modal in multi-select mode, renders thumbnails for each chosen attachment, and stores their IDs in a hidden input that is sanitised by `sanitize_pom_form_gallery()` to contain only digits and commas.【F:src/Fields/Gallery.php†L7-L64】【F:src/class-sanitize.php†L157-L160】 See [Media pickers and assets](../fields.md#media-pickers-and-assets) for practical tips.
