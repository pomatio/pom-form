# File

File renders a standard file input that honours labels and descriptions while delegating sanitization to `sanitize_pom_form_file()`, which lets you filter maximum sizes and allowed MIME types through WordPress filters.【F:src/Fields/File.php†L7-L30】【F:src/class-sanitize.php†L130-L147】 See [Media pickers and assets](../fields.md#media-pickers-and-assets) for integration advice.
